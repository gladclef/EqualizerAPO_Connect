# EqualizerAPO_Connect
App for windows phone 8.1 to connect to the [https://github.com/gladclef/EqualizerAPO](EqualizerAPO desktop program).

Created so that the settings for the desktop program can be adjusted from a remote location (like the center of the dance floor instead of the stage where the computer is).

## Usage
1. Run the EqualizerAPO desktop program.
2. Open this app on your phone.
3. In the desktop program, choose the IP Address that connects your computer to the local router from the dropdown in the upper right corner.
4. In the app, enter this IP Address and tap "Continue." Wait for a message to show up. You may need to repeat this several times before a connection is established.
5. Adjust the filters and volume on the app and watch them change correspondingly on your desktop!
